# Weather App using Python and WAPI

## Overview
This Python project is a simple and user-friendly Weather App that utilizes a weather API, specifically the WAPI (Weather API), to fetch real-time weather information. The application provides users with current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data for a specified location.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Data:** Access up-to-date weather information for any desired location.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The application offers a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with and obtain weather details effortlessly.
- **Customizable:** Users can input the location (city, country) for which they want to retrieve weather information, allowing for a personalized experience.
- **WAPI Integration:** The project is built on the WAPI (Weather API), a reliable and accurate weather data source.

## Getting Started
